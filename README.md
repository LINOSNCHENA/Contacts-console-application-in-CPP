# Device Monitor for a Control systems (Monitoring)

In this application sensors are collectiong data and sending it to a control point
This is an application that is used to monitor four different types of sensors that are used in monitoring the enviroment for a given data center illustrative example. The collected data is then send to the control center. 
This data include measurments of light intensity, temperature, pressure and power levels. 
These measurments are taken to be very vital for a data center monitoring. 
A huge change in any of these measurments could be disastaerous for a data center. Hence this routinme gives warning for the monitors to take caution if such huge change beyoud a certain limit action has to be take to control that huge change.
This application sends data record to control at specific intervals. 
Four threads and two classes are used to implement the task of the requiremends for these monitors.
