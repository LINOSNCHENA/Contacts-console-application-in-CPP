## 5. PURPOSE AND DISCRIPTION
===============================\
In this application sensors are collecting data and sending it to a control point. The collected data is then sent to the control center.  The sending speed is different. These measurements are taken to be very vital for a data center monitoring. A huge change in any of these measurements could be disastrous for a data center. Hence this routine gives warning for the monitors to take caution if such huge change beyond a certain limit action must be taken to control that huge change. This application sends data record to control at specific intervals. Four threads and two classes are used to implement the task of the requirements for these monitors. This task has a java version, Cpp version and a C (See code). Three API considered.
